         <td>My role in this company was diverse, from Graphic designer, engraver, to maintenance of machinery, also
             when new people apply for position assigned as a mentor to teach them. I enjoyed doing graphic
             designs and engravings on all kinds of materials and sport competitions for different city all around
             Croatia and occasion outside. I was intensely using Corel Draw, VersaWorks and other engraving software</td>

             I was assigned to another team which task was to check if the power cables of telecommunications
             electric boxes were correct. This place is where I found that this is not the type of job I really
             want to do so at the end of the year I decided to leave as I didn't find any joy in it.</td>
